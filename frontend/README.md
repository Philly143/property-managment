Front-end:

- Brief introduction with what the project is. General overview of what we did

- Start with the owner

- Registering as owner first

- Goes to owner home where owner adds property

- Log in as admin and go to Admin dashboard where admin approves the add, then the property shows in the owner home. 

- Owner can edit and delete the added propperty





- Now log out and sign in as customer

- This goes to the customer home, where he can see list of properties that owner had added previously

- Customer sends the offer, available status becomes pending. Also saves the property

- That offer is now saved in the offer list inside customer dashboard, also the property is saved in the saved list inside the customer dashboard.

- Customer sends message to owner.

- that message is now updated in the owner dashboard as the message list. Also the offer that customer sent previosuly must be in the offer list inside the owner dashboard

- Now when owner rejects the offer, the pending status changes to available

- If owner accepts the offer, pending status changes to contingent

- now if we go the custoemr dashboard, if the offer is accepted, customer can download the receipt

- Now if owner cancels the contingent, the contingent status changes to available.
